'''
Given two string A and B consisting of lowercase english letters.
You need to find how many ways are there to extract k (>=1) non-overlapping substrings from A such that each of them contains string B as a substring.

More formally, you need to calculate the number of ways to choose two sequences x1, x2, ..., xk and y1, y2, ..., yk satisfying the following requirements:

1 <= xi, yi <= |A| where (1 <= i <= k)
yi >= xi
xi+1 > yi
string B is the substring of Axi Axi+1 ... Ayi (string A is considered as 1-indexed).
As the number of ways can be rather large print it modulo 109+7.

Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 100000
1 <= |B| <= 100000

Input Format
The first argument is string A.
The second argument is string B.

Output Format
Return number of ways to extract k (>=1) non-overlapping substrings from A such that each of them contains string B as a substring modulo (109+7).

Example Input
Input 1:
 A = "bcbcb" 
 B = "bc"
Input 2:
 A = "bbbc"
 B = "bbbc"

Example Output
Output 1:
 10
Output 2:
 1

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
Following are the 10 ways:
["bc"], ["bcb"], ["bcbc"], ["bcbcb"], ["cbc"], ["cbcb"], ["bc"], ["bcb"], ["bc", "bc"], ["bc", "bcb"].
Explanation 2:
 The only substring is "bbbc".
