Problem Description
You are given an array A. You need to find the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence in the array.
In other words, you need to find a subsequence of array A in which the elements are in sorted order, (strictly increasing) and as long as possible.

Problem Constraints
1 ≤ length(A), A[i] ≤ 105

Input Format
The first and only argument of the input is the array A.

Output Format
Output a single integer, the length of the longest increasing subsequence in array A.

Example Input
Input 1:
A: [2, 1, 4, 3]
Input 2:
A: [5, 6, 3, 7, 9]

Example Output
Output 1:
2
Output 2:
4

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 [2, 4] and [1, 3] are the longest increasing sequences of size 2. 
Explanation 2:
The longest increasing subsequence we can get is [5, 6, 7, 9] of size 4.
