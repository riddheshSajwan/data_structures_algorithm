//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
Breadth First Search. 

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
Breadth First Search - DFS will take a really long time

//If the tree is very wide:
Depth First Search - BFS will take too much memory

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
Depth First Search

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
Depth First Search

//Finding the shortest path:
Breadth First Search
