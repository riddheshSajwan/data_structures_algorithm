Problem Description
N people having different priorities are standing in a queue.
The queue follows the property that each person is standing at most B places away from its position in the sorted queue.
Your task is to sort the queue in the increasing order of priorities.

NOTE:
No two persons can have the same priority.
Use the property of the queue to sort the queue with complexity O(NlogB).

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 100000
0 <= B <= N

Input Format
The first argument is an integer array A representing the priorities and initial order of N persons.
The second argument is an integer B.

Output Format
Return an integer array representing the sorted queue.

Example Input
Input 1:
 A = [1, 40, 2, 3]
 B = 2
Input 2:
 A = [2, 1, 17, 10, 21, 95]
 B = 1

Example Output
Output 1:
 [1, 2, 3, 40]
Output 2:
 [1, 2, 10, 17, 21, 95]

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 Given array A = [1, 40, 2, 3]
 After sorting, A = [1, 2, 3, 40].
 We can see that difference between initial position of elements amd the final position <= 2.
Explanation 2:
 After sorting, the array becomes [1, 2, 10, 17, 21, 95].
