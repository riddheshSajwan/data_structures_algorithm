'''
Vertical and Horizontal Sums
Problem Description

Given a matrix B, of size N x M, you are allowed to do at most A special operations on this grid such that there is no vertical or horizontal contiguous subarray that has a sum greater than C.

A special operation involves multiplying any element by -1 i.e. changing its sign.

Return 1 if it is possible to achieve the answer, otherwise 0.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N, M <= 10

0 <= A <= 5

-105 <= B[i][j], C <= 105



Input Format
The first argument is an integer A, representing the number of special operations allowed.
The second argument has the N x M integer matrix, B.
The third argument is an integer C, as described in the problem statement.



Output Format
Return 1 if it is possible to achieve the answer, otherwise 0.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = 3
 B = [  
        [1, 1, 1]
        [1, 1, 1]
        [1, 1, 1]
     ]
 C = 2
Input 2:

 A = 1
 B = [
        [1, 1, 1]
        [1, 1, 1]
        [1, 1, 1]
     ]
 C = 2


Example Output
Output 1:

 1
Output 2:

 0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 The given matrix does not satisfy the conditions, but if we apply the special operation to B[0][0], B[1][1], B[2][2],
 then the matrix would satisfy the given conditions i.e. no row or column has a sum greater than 2.
Explanation 2:

 It is not possible to apply the special operation to 1 element to satisfy the conditions.
